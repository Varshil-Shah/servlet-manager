# SIMPLE SERVLET MANAGER

## Introduction

The servlet manager solves your essential problems for creating and using servlets without the use of extra utilities like maven. It was too boring and time consuming to create a servlet project without any additional utilities. Thus, we came up with this console based application to manage a few essential servlet features.

## Requirements

A Python version greater or equal to 10 is required if you are using any operating system other than windows. Windows users can easily download the exe file.

## Recommended modules

If you are running the project by python, run the following command.

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Installation

It is mandatory to install `tomcat server` on your machine in order to run our application.

## Configuration

Also create a environment variable for `CATALINA_HOME` pointing to the tomcat server folder
JDK version must be greater than 6.
